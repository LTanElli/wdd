      <h4>Welcome to my manga site ranking!</h4>
      <p>
        1 Through this website I will be giving you a small, general ranking of the best places to purchase manga and things related to it. For example, actual physical copies of manga, hard copies of anime, and collectibles. <br><br>

        2 Online shopping has become an incredible scene over the past twenty years. You can quite literally find anything you might ever want or need. For people who live in small rural areas, many things have been made available through the power of the internet and shipping services. For many people it is just more convenient to order something online compared to finding that something in a physical store. For some that task may require driving hours, and even after that it may not be guaranteed that it is in stock. I have had that experience before, and it just plain stinks. Thus, again, it can be easier to use the internet, but for manga where do you even start looking? A simple google search? That can lead to some sketchy sites, or to big company sites that may not have what you are looking for, or to some upstart sites that have everything. These will all be explored in this ranking.<br><br>
        
        3 There are some specific things that will be in major consideration for what makes one site better than the other. Like everything, there are advantages and disadvantages to many things in life. Those will be explored with the topics that are in consideration. Those topics are as follows: price, shipping cost, shipping time, user friendliness, variety, and packaging. This ranking is built upon my own opinion, research, and experience to provide information for those looking to find the best place to get there manga fix. At the bottom of the page will be where you can direct back and forth through the rankings. <br><br>

        4 A little spoiler before that however. You may be surprised to find that Amazon is not on this list, even though it is a small one. Amazon is huge, has nearly everything you can buy, and the best shipping system. Everyone should already know about Amazon and be familiar with what it has. As you go through this list you can use that knowledge as a reference and compare how good it is to each place on this list yourself.<br><br>

        Okay, now you can move on!

        price, shipping cost, shipping time, user friendliness, variety, and packaging.     Put this as a dotted list.

      </ul>
      <h3>"Rank 2" and "Rank 3"</h3>
      <p>
        Coming in at the last spot is both Walmart and Target. Each of these are similar and will be in one spot. These big retailers made it on this list because they are reliable to a point. They have their own online websites that you can order from. Becasue they are big retailers, they have a good reputation, and, consistency. The actual price for manga items is not bad. Never going above the average retail price for each item, and sometimes even getting below it. With membership programs you could get discounts, less shipping cost, and less shipping time. If not, then the shipping cost is average and the shipping time is dependant on how rural you really live.<br><br>
        
        User friendliness is pretty good for these websites. I would attribute that to them being big companies that are well established. This is the same reason why the packaging is okay. They are well establsihed, so the quality of these things does not suffer. The thing that does suffer is variety. Big retailers focus more on providing mainstream things and basic needs. Usually, only the most popular series are in stock. Which is fine if that is what you are collecting. But if you are looking to expand your collection on Dorohedoro, or any other example that is not as popular, then you will need to look elsewhere.<br><br>


        Rank 3 would be BooksAMillion. BooksAMillion is like the Barnes and Noble's weird cousin. Kinda cool, but just not as good as Barnes and Noble. For the most part the website here sticks very close to the expected retail price. Occasional deals. The membership can give you faster shipping time, and discounts on shipping costs. Depending on how fast you want it delivered, the cost will vary. For members, standard shipping is free. For non-members standard shipping is 3 bucks per order and .99 cents per item. Those both go up as you select faster shipping times. Member or non member. <br><br>

        The website is fairly user friendly. It is sort of basic. Not really unique in any way. But it is functional, which is all that is needed. Being a bookstore that is big enough to have a website, the variety is pretty good. You could buy a whole series at once if you really wanted to. For this reason, it is above the retailer duo. Packaging is average. About the same quality you would get with anything else. The box does say "BAM!" on it which is sort of cool.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        The runner up in this ranking is Barnes and Noble. As a physical bookstore, this would be the number one, hands down, without a doubt. Likely one of, if not, the most well established book store chain. The locations are huge, they have everything in terms of books. Stock can slightly alter in person, like any other store would. And of course, it has a website! Duh, it's on this list. The bookstore nature is to be more accurate to expected retail cost than even big retailers. Which is a good thing. Consistency is good. That being said, it is above the other bookstore on this list for several reasons, one of them being that Barnes and Noble has more to offer in terms of discounts. Members can get 10% off their whole order. The shipping time is a little better, but the shipping cost is a bit worse if you are not a member, or if you don't order $40 or more. <br><br>
        
        The website is more visually appealing and user friendly than BooksAMillion as well. The variety is about the same though. Despite Barnes and Noble having a better name and bigger reputation, BooksAMillion is also a good bookstore, and the variety between these two is pretty equal. The packaging is the same as well. These book stores quality does not suffer. <br><br>


        Rank number 1 is easily Rightstuf. This website, this company, is built to be purely for every manga fan, and purely online. For the most part the prices are the same, but, Rightstuf delivers tons of deals. Much more than anything else. It can be hit or miss sometimes with what exactly is on sale, but when it hits something you in particular have your eyes on, then there are big savings. And they are really good at getting a lot of series under expected retail value. More so than any other site that I know of. One of the only drawbacks of this site is the shipping. The shipping can get quite expensive. You can get free shipping on orders above $70 though if it does not contain a box set. and depending on what is in your cart, you can get free shipping if you choose the longest shipping time. Which is a good trade off to me. There is no membership, but that's because they offer so much without needing one.<br><br>

        The user friendliness of the website is good. The website itself has a great design, but can be slow or glitchy. These problems have mostly been fixed, and it is hard to fault them when they are a small company providing a great product and service. The variety is the best on this website. For manga in particular, there are some things that even plain book stores don't have when it comes to manga. Rightstuf literally has everything manga and anime related. Manga and figurines and anime dvd copies and even clothes. Lastly, their packaging has been the best in my own experience. Great care and caution is taken when shipping your items. I think this is all because it is a company made by manga lovers, for manga lovers.
