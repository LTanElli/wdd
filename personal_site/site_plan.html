Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Home page will have information on what the website is about. Initially, they will know what the website will be about becuase of the url, and the website name. Even so, a more in depth explanation will take up the first page of the website. This information will specifically state that the next couple of pages will rank the top 4 places to purchase manga books over the internet. This information will explain that each place on the rank will have information alongside its standing describing what exactly is taken into account for its ranking.
        
        Some of the main considerations for the spots in this ranking will be as follows: price, shipping cost, shipping time, user friendliness, variety, and packaging. It will be mentioned that this ranking is off my own opinions and my own experience. The bottom of the page the user will be prompted to go to the next page where the ranking begins.

        The user will also be told that Amazon will not be included on the list. If you have prime you have free shipping with prime objects. And Amazon has almost everything. More so than many things on this list. I did not feel that it would be fair to include it. 

        Actual written content will be edited later.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Page two will have rank number 4 and rank number 3. 

        Rank number 4 will be large retailers like walmart and target. They have their own websites that you can order from. The size of the retailer helps to give them a certain amount of reputation and trust when it comes to several things. Your purchase and your payment information will be protected. Your package will be delivered. (information on which delivery they use?) The package will also be well put together. Large companies have resources and need to uphold a good image to keep their empire standing. For places like walmart they have a reputation for having a little bit of everything that one may need, so the variety suffers a little bit and only the most mainstream manga series are available. But because they are large retailers, the prices are very consitenent and equal to market value. shipping prices aren't that bad.

        Rank 3 would be BooksAMillion. Large book store that has a website that delivers as well. (find what shipping service they use?) I need more information on BooksAMillion, it is similar to Barnes and Noble.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will have rank number 2 and rank number 1. Rank number 2 will be Barnes and Noble. Along with probably being the best book retailer chain, they also have a great online service. Prices are the same as everything above it. Shipping is normal as well. Barnes and Noble has a membership program that gets you 10% off and can reduce shipping costs. (more research on that.) The prices are usually the same as what they are in the store. Deals come around every now and then. 

        Rank number 1 is easily Rightstuf. Most prices are the same, but there are also a lot of deals that put a lot of manga below retail price. It is surprising how many deals they have. The variety is also the best. Barnes and Noble is the only other thing that has almost as good of a variety.
