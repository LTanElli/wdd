                <p class="page3-info">The runner up in this ranking is Barnes and Noble. As a physical bookstore, this would be the number one, hands down, without a doubt. Likely one of, if not, the most well established book store chain. The locations are huge, they have everything in terms of books. Stock can slightly alter in person, like any other store would. And of course, it has a website! Duh, it's on this list. The bookstore nature is to be more accurate to expected retail cost than even big retailers. Which is a good thing. Consistency is good. That being said, it is above the other bookstore on this list for several reasons, one of them being that Barnes and Noble has more to offer in terms of discounts. Members can get 10% off their whole order. The shipping time is a little better, but the shipping cost is a bit worse if you are not a member, or if you don't order $40 or more. <br><br> The website is more visually appealing and user friendly than BooksAMillion as well. The variety is about the same though. Despite Barnes and Noble having a better name and bigger reputation, BooksAMillion is also a good bookstore, and the variety between these two is pretty equal. The packaging is the same as well. These book stores quality does not suffer.</p>

                <h2 class="page3h2-2">Rank Number 1</h2>
                <p class="page3h2-2-sub">Right Stuf Anime</p>
                <div class="rightstuf-container">
                    <img class="rightstuf-img" src="pics/rightstuf.jpg" alt="Right stuff logo">
                </div>
                <p class="page3-info2">Rank number 1 is easily Rightstuf. This website, this company, is built to be purely for every manga fan, and purely online. For the most part the prices are the same, but, Rightstuf delivers tons of deals. Much more than anything else. It can be hit or miss sometimes with what exactly is on sale, but when it hits something you in particular have your eyes on, then there are big savings. And they are really good at getting a lot of series under expected retail value. More so than any other site that I know of. One of the only drawbacks of this site is the shipping. The shipping can get quite expensive. You can get free shipping on orders above $70, though, if it does not contain a box set. and depending on what is in your cart, you can get free shipping if you choose the longest shipping time. Which is a good trade off to me. There is no membership, but that's because they offer so much without needing one. <br><br> The user friendliness of the website is good. The website itself has a great design, but can be slow or glitchy. These problems have mostly been fixed, and it is hard to fault them when they are a small company providing a great product and service. The variety is the best on this website. For manga in particular, there are some things that even plain book stores don't have when it comes to manga. Rightstuf literally has everything manga and anime related. Manga and figurines and anime dvd copies and even clothes. Lastly, their packaging has been the best in my own experience. Great care and caution is taken when shipping your items. I think this is all because it is a company made by manga lovers, for manga lovers. <br><br><br> That is all for this ranking!</p>
