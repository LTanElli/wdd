                <p class="page2-info">Coming in at the last spot is both Walmart and Target. Each of these are similar and will be in one spot. These big retailers made it on this list because they are reliable to a point. They have their own online websites that you can order from. Becasue they are big retailers, they have a good reputation, and, consistency. The actual price for manga items is not bad. Never going above the average retail price for each item, and sometimes even getting below it. With membership programs you could get discounts, less shipping cost, and less shipping time. If not, then the shipping cost is average and the shipping time is dependant on how rural you really live. <br><br> User friendliness is pretty good for these websites. I would attribute that to them being big companies that are well established. This is the same reason why the packaging is okay. They are well establsihed, so the quality of these things does not suffer. The thing that does suffer is variety. Big retailers focus more on providing mainstream things and basic needs. Usually, only the most popular series are in stock. Which is fine if that is what you are collecting. But if you are looking to expand your collection on Dorohedoro, or any other example that is not as popular, then you will need to look elsewhere.

                <p class="page2-info2">Rank 3 would be BooksAMillion. BooksAMillion is like the Barnes and Noble's weird cousin. Kinda cool, but just not as good as Barnes and Noble. For the most part the website here sticks very close to the expected retail price. Occasional deals. The membership can give you faster shipping time, and discounts on shipping costs. Depending on how fast you want it delivered, the cost will vary. For members, standard shipping is free. For non-members standard shipping is 3 bucks per order and .99 cents per item. Those both go up as you select faster shipping times. Member or non member. <br><br> The website is fairly user friendly. It is sort of basic. Not really unique in any way. But it is functional, which is all that is needed. Being a bookstore that is big enough to have a website, the variety is pretty good. You could buy a whole series at once if you really wanted to. For this reason, it is above the retailer duo. Packaging is average. About the same quality you would get with anything else. The box does say "BAM!" on it which is sort of cool. <br><br> That's all for this page! Navigation is at the top or the bottom of the page.</p>
