                <h2 class="homeh2">Welcome to my Manga Website Ranking</h2>
                <p class="home-info">Through this website I will be giving you a small, general ranking of the best places to purchase manga and things related to it. For example, actual physical copies of manga, hard copies of anime, and collectibles. <br><br> Online shopping has become an incredible scene over the past twenty years. You can quite literally find anything you might ever want or need. For people who live in small rural areas, many things have been made available through the power of the internet and shipping services. For many people it is just more convenient to order something online compared to finding that something in a physical store. For some that task may require driving hours, and even after that it may not be guaranteed that it is in stock. I have had that experience before, and it just plain stinks. Thus, again, it can be easier to use the internet, but for manga where do you even start looking? A simple google search? That can lead to some sketchy sites, or to big company sites that may not have what you are looking for, or to some upstart sites that have everything. These will all be explored in this ranking.</p>

                <h2>How Are These Sites Ranked?</h2>
                <p>There are some specific things that will be in major consideration for what makes one site better than the other. Like everything, there are advantages and disadvantages to many things in life. Those will be explored with the topics that are in consideration. Those topics are as follows: price, shipping cost, shipping time, user friendliness, variety, and packaging. This ranking is built upon my own opinion, research, and experience to provide information for those looking to find the best place to get there manga fix. At the bottom of the page will be where you can direct back and forth through the rankings. <br><br> A little spoiler before that however. You may be surprised to find that Amazon is not on this list, even though it is a small one. Amazon is huge, has nearly everything you can buy, and the best shipping system. Everyone should already know about Amazon and be familiar with what it has. As you go through this list you can use that knowledge as a reference and compare how good it is to each place on this list yourself. <br><br> Okay, now you can move on!</p>
