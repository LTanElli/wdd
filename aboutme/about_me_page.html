    <h2>Lynn Tanner Elliott</h2>
    <h2>I go by my middle name, Tanner</h2>
    <p>My name is Tanner, I come from a town in Arizona called Prescott. Locals call it "Preskitt", including me.
    In prescott I got my Associtates degree and decided to transfer up here and change my area of study from Business
    Management to Computer Information Technology.
    </p>
    <p>I am in this class because I believe this course is in my programming certificate, or my main degree. I don't
     remember exactly. Either way, learning to create a website is something that I want to learn and I believe it is 
     applicable to my degree and it is something that I will certainly use in my life.
    </p>
    <p>Some things about me are that I like to play video games. Specifically with friends or family, but on my own too.
    I also love to be outdoors. I love hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, white water rafting/kayaking.
